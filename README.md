This project is a dynamic weather application built using the OpenWeather API. It fetches real-time weather data based on user input and displays it in a simple interface.

I focused on writing clean and maintainable code by using React Query (useQuery) to manage API requests efficiently. Additionally, I implemented three extra features beyond the basic requirements. However, I did not focus heavily on design.

Features
✅ Fetches and displays real-time weather data from OpenWeather API
✅ Utilizes useQuery for efficient data fetching and caching
✅ Implements three additional features as required
✅ Simple UI with essential information

The design is kept minimal since the focus was on functionality and clean code structure.
The app ensures smooth API integration using useQuery.
